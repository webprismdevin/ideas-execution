      <p>Hi there ðŸ˜Š</p>
      <p>
        If you've found this - man, you're early. I've been running{" "}
        <a href="https://webprism.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          WEBPRISM
        </a>{" "}
        since the end of 2019. It's finally time I build a portfolio for myself.
      </p>
      <p>Why am I building this? Two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I want to experiment with <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>
        </li>
        <li>I'm a marketing professional. It makes sense to market myself.</li>
        <li>I like to write. It's human. I need somewhere to put it.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>What will exist here?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>code experiments</li>
        <li>writings and musings</li>
        <li>portfolio pieces</li>
        <li>other stuff too, probably</li>
      </ul>
