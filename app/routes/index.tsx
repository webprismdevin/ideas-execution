        since the end of 2019. It's finally time I build a portfolio for myself.
      </p>
      <p>Why am I building this? Two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I want to experiment with Remix</li>
        <li>I'm a marketing professional. It makes sense to market myself.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>What will exist here?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>code experiments</li>
        <li>writings and musings</li>
        <li>portfolio pieces</li>
        <li>other stuff too, probably</li>
      </ul>
